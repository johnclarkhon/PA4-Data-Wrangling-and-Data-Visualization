# PA4-Data-Wrangling-and-Data-Visualization

## Author
### Name: John Clark D. Honrado
### Section: 2ECE-A


## Requirements before doing the project:
1. Install the latest version of Python
2. Get Anaconda Navigator installed
3. Make sure to have Pandas library using "pip list" in cmd-administrator to check all the installed libraries, if not type "pip install numpy" to install it



## Steps in doing the project:
1. Open Anaconda Navigator
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook (You will then be redirected to the Web application)
3. On the top-right corner, click New > Python 3 (ipykernel), to create new .ipynb file
4. Refer on PA4_HONRADO_2ECE-A.ipynb for the codes



## Project Descriptions:

### PROBLEM 1: First and Last 5 Rows of DataFrame:
Steps:
1. Load the corresponding .csv file into a data frame named cars using pandas
2. Display the first five and last five rows of the resulting cars.
3. Save the file as python, refer on Honrado_Pandas-P1.py.

### PROBLEM 2: Extracting Using Subsetting, Slicing and Indexing Operations:
Steps:
1. Display the first five rows with odd-numbered columns (columns 1, 3, 5, 7...) of cars.
2. Display the row that contains the ‘Model’ of ‘Mazda RX4’.
3. How many cylinders (‘cyl’) does the car model ‘Camaro Z28’ have?
4. Determine how many cylinders (‘cyl’) and what gear type (‘gear’) do the car models ‘Mazda RX4 Wag’, ‘Ford Pantera L’ and ‘Honda Civic’ have.
5. Save the file as python, refer on Honrado_Pandas-P2.py
