## Project Descriptions:

### ECE BOARD EXAM PROBLEM:
Using data wrangling and data visualization technique with storytelling, analyze the data and present different (i) data frames; and (ii) visuals using the dataset given.

1. Create the following data frames based on the format provided:
   a. Filename: Instru = [“Name”, “GEAS”, “Electronics >70”]; where track is constant as Instrumentation and hometown Luzon
   b. Filename: Mindy = [ “Name”, “Track”, “Electronics”, “Average >=55”]; where hometown is constant as Mindanao and gender Female

2. Create a visualization that shows how the different features contributes to average grade. Does chosen track in college, gender, or hometown contributes to a higher average score?
